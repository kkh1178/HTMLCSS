            <h3 id="tribute-info"> Here is how <a id="tribute-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Harrison_(blood_donor)" target="_blank">Mr. James Harrison</a> became a prolific blood donor and saved the lives of <a id="tribute-link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/05/11/health/james-harrison-blood-donor-retires-trnd/index.html" target="_blank">2.4 million children</a>:</h3> 
            <ul>
            <li>James Harrison was born on 27 December 1936. At the age of 14, he underwent major chest surgery, requiring 13 litres (2.9 imp gal; 3.4 US gal) of blood.
                After surgery, he was in the hospital for three months. Realizing the blood had saved his life, he made a pledge to start donating blood as soon as he turned 18, the then-required age.
            </li>
            <li>Harrison started donating in 1954 and after the first few donations it was discovered that his blood contained unusually strong and persistent antibodies against the D Rh group antigen.  
                The discovery of these antibodies led to the development of immune globulin based products to prevent hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN). </li>
            <li>These products, which contain a high level of anti-D antibodies are given to Rh(D) negative mothers of unknown or Rh(D) positive babies during and after pregnancy to prevent the creation of antibodies to 
                the blood of a Rh(D) positive child. This antigen sensitization and subsequent incompatibility phenomenon causes Rhesus disease, the most common form of HDN.</li>
            <li>Through the donations of his plasma, Harrison has helped prevent thousands of children from dying of HDN. This uniqueness was considered so important, that his life was insured for one million dollars  
                after this discovery and the following research based on his donations created the commercial Anti-D immune globulin commonly known as RhoGAM.</li>
            <li>His donations were estimated to have helped save over 2.4 million babies, with pregnant women, including his own daughter Tracey, being treated with his antibodies.</li>
            <li> Harrison has donated blood plasma over 1,100 times through the Australian Red Cross Anti-D program. As blood plasma, in contrast to blood, can be donated as often as once every 2 weeks, he was able to 
                reach his 1000th donation in May 2011. This results in an average of one donation every three weeks during 57 years.</li>
            <li> Harrison has surpassed the donor age limit of 81. “It’s a sad day for me. The end of a long run,” 
                Harrison, 81, told The Sydney Morning Herald on the day of his last donation. “I'd keep on going if they'd let me.”
